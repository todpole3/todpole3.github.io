                                            Backpropagation is a leaky abstraction; it is a credit assignment scheme with non-trivial consequences. If you try to ignore how it works under the hood because “TensorFlow automagically makes my networks learn”, you will not be ready to wrestle with the dangers it presents, and you will be much less effective at building and debugging neural networks.

                                            Rapid iteration is also a prime currency in enabling innovation and discovery...
                                            baselines tend to be artificial, tiny, ancient, ignored, and rarely updated to modern best practices or techniques.
                                            When we lose accurate baselines, we lose our ability to accurately measure our progress over time.

                                                Careers are long relative to PhDs, and so you should definitely not feel constrained to stay within the confines of whatever area you did your PhD research.  Post-PhD, try to put yourself in an environment where you can work on a wide variety of areas, w/ colleagues who have
                                                a wide variety of interests and expertise and then let your own curiosity take you into different areas... As you do this a few times throughout your career, you gradually build a bigger and bigger "tool belt" of techniques and approaches and kinds of expertise.

                                                A great leadership style can make people appear more competent than they truly are, and a poor style can drag down a superior skill set... Style is distinct from personality... Power and attractiveness, neither set of markers is inherently good or bad...
                                                Lean powerful with more-senior people, and lean attractive when talking to more-junior people... leadership style cannot be fully divorced from unconscious biases and discrimination... Minorities who do not conform to an organization’s dominant culture may be penalized.
